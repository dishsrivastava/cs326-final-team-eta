We created multiple endpoints for two objects: users and rooms. For users, we had two GET methods, login (/userLogin) and userInfo (/userInfo), one POST method, createAccount (/createaccount/new), and one DELETE method, deleteAccount (/user/delete). For rooms, we had three GET requests, findByName (/room/findByName), roomProfile (/room/roomProfile), and availableRooms (/room/availableRooms).
