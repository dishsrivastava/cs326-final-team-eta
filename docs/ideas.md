### Innovative Idea

UMeet is a web application used to book meeting/event spaces around campus, specifically for clubs and RSO's to book rooms more easily.  This web app will include functionality for users to leave comments on their experience using specific rooms, a rating system, and functionality to view your e-board team bookings.  Furthermore, other users can upvote comments.

There is an existing library application in order to book rooms in the library.  Since the rooms provided by the library are too small to host large RSO and club groups, these library rooms cannot be used by RSOâ€™s and clubâ€™s in order to hold events or meetings.  
Instead, we would like to create a platform which will make it easier for clubs and RSOs to book large meeting spaces in order to host their events in a standardized and articulate manner.

### Important Concepts

For reference: *user* is a representation of a student who is part of a student organization.

Key functionality #1: A user can create an account and log in to UMeet, storing all their past room bookings, reviews, and can join specific clubâ€™s or RSO'sgroups. When creating an account, the user will be prompted to submit the email of their clubâ€™s or RSO's assigned faculty advisor, and the faculty advisor will be notified via email of this request. If the faculty advisor approves the userâ€™s request, they will be added to UMeet.   

ðŸ”‘ functionality #2: Users can view all available classrooms and event spaces on campus at a specific date and time, and book spaces directly on UMeet. Since users are approved during account creation, once they are approved and on the platform they can directly book event spaces. Users are sent an email confirmation once their room is booked. 

ðŸ”‘ functionality #3: Users can leave comments for each room and include tags such as accessibility, environment & surroundings, technology access, size (ex. 20+, 50+, 75+, 100+), room type (ex. lecture, TBL, event space). 

ðŸ”‘ functionality #4: Users can see if other e-board members have booked a room.  Furthermore, all e-board members receive confirmation email when a room is booked.  

ðŸ”‘ functionality #5: Users can search/filter through the rooms available based on criteria like time and size.
