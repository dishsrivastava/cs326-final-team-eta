### Innovative Idea

For reference: *user* is a representation of a student who is part of a student organization.

ðŸ”‘ functionality #1: A user can create an account and log in to UMeet, storing all their past room bookings, reviews, and can join specific clubâ€™s groups. When creating an account, the user will be prompted to submit the email of their clubâ€™s assigned faculty advisor, and the faculty advisor will be notified via email of this request. If the faculty advisor approves the userâ€™s request, they will be added to UMeet.   

ðŸ”‘ functionality #2: Users can view all available classrooms and event spaces on campus at a specific date and time, and book spaces directly on the web app. Since users are approved during account creation, once they are approved and on the platform they can direct book event spaces. Users are sent an email confirmation once their room is booked. 

ðŸ”‘ functionality #3: Users can leave comments for each room and include tags such as accessibility, environment & surroundings, technology access, size (20+, 50+, 75+, 100+), room type (lecture, TBL, event space). 

ðŸ”‘ functionality #4: Users can see if other e-board members have booked a room, All e-board members receive confirmation email when room is booked.  

ðŸ”‘ functionality #5: Users can search/filter through the rooms available based on certain attributes like time and size.
