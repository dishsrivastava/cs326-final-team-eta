# Milestone #1 

## Part 0: Data Interactions
Our project idea has not changed since Milestone 0. 
- User Information Data: We have a login system in our project UMeet, which requires a user to enter their email and a password. Due to this, their email and password will be stored and linked to their account. Other user data, such as clubs and organizations, previous and upcoming room bookings, and the student's advisor will also be associated with the user. 
- Room Building Data: Each room will have data regarding the room name, number, building, capacity, description and rating.
    - Room Rating Data: Each rating for a room will be made as the average of ratings made by users for the particular room.
    - Current Bookings / Upcoming Availabilties Data: When users complete a booking submission, the specific times and dates of the booking, along with the user/organization that made the booking, will be associated with the room.

## Part 1: Wireframes
We started our wireframe diagram process by hand-drawing our wireframes, and translating the drawing to Figma for more refined wireframes.
